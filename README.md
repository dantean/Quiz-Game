## Credit Where Credit Is Due

I followed along with instructor Phil's instructions for this assignment, but decided to update it to use ES6 instead of ES5 since I want to learn ES6 better. I struggled with making the changes and utilized chatGPT to fix some errors, but was still encountering lots of problems. I was then helped by tutors Ntombifuthi, Carlin, and Mansi. Thanks so much for all the assistance!
